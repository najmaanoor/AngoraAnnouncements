# AngoraAnnouncements
I noticed that in my high school, the announcements could easily be missed. Many students are not inside the building because of the different learning programs we have. For example, I am a dual enrollment student and take my classes at a nearby college. The students who are out of the building in the morning can still hear the afternoon announcements, but it does not repeat the same information. Students and teachers can inform each other verbally; however, some details can be left out. A technological solution for this problem would be an app that shares the announcements. The information can appear as notifications or text messages. The majority of the students have an electronic device to download the app, and they can forward the news to each other. Students can be aware of extra-curricular activities, bus route changes, testing schedules, and more. Everyone will be up to date with the same information regardless of their location.
